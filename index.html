            <h1 class="name">Just Joe Goode</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Joe! I spent most of my adult life traveling and living across Canada. <br> I come from Ontario originally, leaving the province when I was 23. <br> I spent about a decade working in Alberta as a commercial driver, before settling here in Port Alberni where I bought my first home!</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>This is my first time attending any sort of post-secondary education</li>
            <li class="right">In 2021, I completed a basic Web Design and Development certificate</li>
            <li>After completeing the course, I participated in a brief work experience with a local company</li>
            <li class="right">2 of the 3 sites I built there are still live!</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="icons">
            <p>A few of the coding languages I learned (mainly just basics):</p>
                <i class="fab fa-html5"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-css3-alt"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-js"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-php"></i>
                <p>It’s easy to lose a lot of what you’ve learned in this industry if you don’t continue practicing and staying up-to-date, as mentioned in one of the opening videos of the course. After completing my studies, I wasn’t able to find work in the field due to the impact of COVID-19, so I returned to my previous career. Unfortunately, I sustained an injury that led to surgery, resulting in permanent nerve damage. I hope to gain a new perspective and learn aspects that may have felt rushed or not properly explained previously. <br> 
                    More responsive and less static designs are the goal! I plan to use these foundations toward my App Development certificate!
                    <br><br>
                Moral of the story: Don’t let your skills fade and keep pushing forward!</p>
